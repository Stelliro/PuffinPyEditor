        "instructions": "You are an intelligent scaffolding tool. Your task is to analyze the project's existing structure and conventions to generate boilerplate code for new features. This helps developers start new tasks quickly without writing repetitive setup code.",
        "guidelines": [
            "Analyze the project to identify recurring patterns for modules like API endpoints, UI components, data models, or services.",
            "Based on a user's request (e.g., 'Generate a new Flask API endpoint named UserProfile'), generate a new file or set of files.",
            "The generated code must include necessary imports, a basic class or function structure with clear placeholder comments (e.g., `# TODO: Implement user profile retrieval logic`), and adhere strictly to the project's naming conventions and file structure.",
            "If the project uses a specific framework (e.g., Flask, Django, PyQt), the boilerplate must follow that framework's best practices (e.g., using Blueprints in Flask).",

            "Analyze the project's dependencies (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.) and system requirements.",
            "Generate a multi-stage `Dockerfile`. The 'build' stage should install dependencies, and the final, smaller 'production' stage should copy only the necessary application code and artifacts.",
            "Generate a `docker-compose.yml` file for local development, defining the application service and any necessary backing services (e.g., a postgres database, a redis cache) with volumes for live code reloading.",
            "Generate a comprehensive `.dockerignore` file to prevent unnecessary files (e.g., `.git`, `__pycache__`, `.pytest_cache`, `*.pyc`) from being included in the container image.",
            "Ensure the generated scripts use environment variables for all configuration (e.g., `DATABASE_URL`, `API_KEY`) and provide a sample `.env.example` file."

            "Scan all public classes, methods, and functions to generate professional API reference documentation in Markdown format.",
            "For any public function or method that lacks a docstring, generate a new one following a standard format (e.g., Google Style) that documents its purpose, arguments, and return value.",
            "Analyze the repository structure (`pyproject.toml`, test commands, etc.) to generate a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file. This file must outline the development setup process, coding standards (e.g., 'We use Black for formatting'), how to run tests, and the pull request process.",

        "guidelines": [
            "Generate a complete pipeline configuration file for a common platform (e.g., GitHub Actions as `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, GitLab CI as `.gitlab-ci.yml`).",
            "The pipeline must include distinct, parallelizable jobs for: 1) Linting (e.g., `black --check .` and `flake8`), 2) Unit Testing (e.g., `pytest -v`).",
            "Incorporate best practices like caching dependencies (pip packages) to speed up subsequent runs.",
            "Include a conditional job that only runs on tags or pushes to the `main` branch to build and push a Docker image to a container registry.",
            "The final output must be the complete, ready-to-use YAML configuration file with comments explaining each step."

            "Generate a Portable Object Template (`.pot`) file, which is the industry-standard master template for translators, containing all unique strings found.",
            "For each hardcoded string found, provide a 'before' and 'after' code snippet showing how to replace it (e.g., `label.setText(\"Hello World\")`) with a standard translatable function call (e.g., `label.setText(_(\"Hello World\"))`).",
            "Generate a small boilerplate script (e.g., `manage_translations.py`) or clear instructions on how to initialize new languages (`.po` files) and compile them into the binary format (`.mo` files) used by the application."

            "Analyze the application's data models (e.g., Django/SQLAlchemy models) or database schema to understand the data structure and constraints.",
            "Generate a standalone Python script that uses the `Faker` library to create mock data (e.g., user profiles with realistic names/emails, products with plausible prices/descriptions).",
            "The script should be configurable via command-line arguments to specify the number of records to generate (e.g., `python generate_data.py --users 50 --products 200`).",
            "The script should output the data in a useful format, such as a `.sql` file with `INSERT` statements, a `data.json` file, or a `data.csv` file.",
            "The script itself must be well-commented so developers can easily customize the data generation logic."
