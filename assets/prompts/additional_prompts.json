      "Break down the code into logical chunks and explain each part step-by-step.",
      "Use analogies to real-world concepts to explain programming ideas (e.g., 'a variable is like a labeled box where you can store information').",
      "Explain the 'why' behind the code, not just the 'what'. What problem does this code solve?",
